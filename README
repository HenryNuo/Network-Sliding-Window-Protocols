# Introduction
This program creates a socket connection between two machines with the purpose of simulating the packet process while transferring a file.

# Terminology
Sender - The sender is the primary code that acts as the client for the file transfer process and indicates all of the simulation details such as: Packet Size, Timeout, Protocol, Sliding Window Size, and Sequence Number

Receiver - The receiver is the server side of the system which receives data from the sender, sends back an ACK, then reconstructs the file in a new location.

# How to Compile

Sender (creates a binary named "sender"):
	CMD: make sender

Receiver (creates a binary named "receiver"):
	CMD: make receiver

# How to Run

Step 1: Start up the receiver by doing the following:
	CMD: ./receiver <port>    
Port = port we want to use for the listening server. Example: ./receiver 9000

Step 2: Start up the sender
	CMD: ./sender

Step 3: Enter settings indicating the file you want to transfer, where you want to transfer it (IP Address Only), and simulation settings for the packet process.

Step 4: Wait for the simulation to finish

# Validate Results

Verify the results on each server using:
	md5sum <input-file> or md5 <input-file>
	md5sum <output-file> or md5 <output-file>

If all goes well, those two should show matching md5 hashes indicating a successful transfer.
